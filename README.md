Shaping Rewards for LifeLong Reinforcement Learning

Code for experimenting with proposed approaches to Lifelong RL, attached to our 2021 IEEE SMC paper "Accelerating lifelong reinforcement learning via reshaping rewards".

The public websibe of paper will come soon.

To reproduce all of our plots, run main.py. Note that you must choose your learning algorithm or parameters inside the code to generate Figures. Numerical results can be found in the paper.
