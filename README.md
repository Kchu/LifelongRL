# Python implementation of Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (Lifelong RL / LLRL). 

## SR-LLRL
Shaping Rewards for LifeLong Reinforcement Learning

Code for experimenting with proposed approaches to Lifelong RL, attached to our 2021 IEEE SMC paper "Accelerating lifelong reinforcement learning via reshaping rewards".

Authors: Kun Chu, Xianchao Zhu, William Zhu.

The paper will be publicly accessible soon.

To reproduce all of our plots, run main.py. Note that you must choose your learning algorithm or parameters inside the code to generate Figures. Numerical results can be found in the paper.

## Note
These codes need to import some libraries of python, especially [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl) provided by [David Abel](https://github.com/david-abel). However, please note that I have made some improvements and changes based on his codes, so please download the simple_rl inside the fold directly instead of installing from the python official libraries!

## Acknowledgment

Here I want to sincerely thank [David Abel](https://david-abel.github.io/), a great young scientist. He generously shared the source code of his paper and gave detailed answers to any of my questions/doubts in the process of conducting this research. I admire his academic achievements, and more importantly, his enthusiastic help and scientific spirit.
