# Python implementation of Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (Lifelong RL / LLRL). 
## Note
These codes need to import some libraries of python, especially [simple_rl](https://github.com/david-abel/simple_rl) provided by David Abel. However, please note that I have made some improvements and changes based on his codes, so please download the simple_rl inside the fold directly instead of installing the version of python official library!
# SR-LLRL
Shaping Rewards for LifeLong Reinforcement Learning

Code for experimenting with proposed approaches to Lifelong RL, attached to our 2021 IEEE SMC paper "Accelerating lifelong reinforcement learning via reshaping rewards".

The public websibe of paper will come soon.

To reproduce all of our plots, run main.py. Note that you must choose your learning algorithm or parameters inside the code to generate Figures. Numerical results can be found in the paper.
