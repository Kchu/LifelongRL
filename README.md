# Python implementation of Lifelong Reinforcement Learning. 
# SR-LLRL: Shaping Rewards for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning
The codes are for the experiments of paper "Accelerating lifelong reinforcement learning via reshaping rewards", which is accepted by 2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC). 

The public websibe will come soon.

Numerical results can be found in the paper.
